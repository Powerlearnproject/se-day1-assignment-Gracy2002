Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
It is the application of a systematic, disciplined quantifiable approach to the development, operation and maintenance of software, that is the application of engineering to software.It is the backbone of  the modern world. From  development ofapps to secure banking systems and online learning platforms.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1.Birth of Software Engineering  – The term was first used at the NATO Software Engineering Conference to address the "software crisis," where projects were failing due to poor planning and management.
2.Introduction of Object-Oriented Programming – The development of languages like Smalltalk and C++ led to the adoption of object-oriented programming (OOP), improving code reuse and maintainability.
3.Agile and DevOps Movements  – The Agile Manifesto introduced iterative development, emphasizing flexibility and collaboration. DevOps later emerged to integrate development and operations for faster delivery.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Idea generation - define project goals
Requirement analysis -gather and document system requirements
Product design - Create software architecture and design specifications
Product development - write and develop actual software
Integration and testing - validate functionality and fix defects
Deployment - release software to users
Maintenance - updating and fixing bugs  

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

On approach, waterfallis linear and sequential while agile is iterative and incremental
On Flexibility, waterfall is rigid while agile is highly flexible
In testing waterfall, it is done after development while in agile, it is continuous throughout.

Examples:

Waterfall: Developing a flight control system where strict documentation and predictability are required.
Agile: Creating a mobile app that requires frequent updates based on user feedback.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer – Writes and maintains code, follows coding standards, and implements features.
Quality Assurance  Engineer – Designs and executes tests to identify software defects.
Project Manager – Oversees project timelines, manages resources, and ensures team coordination.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) streamline coding by providing debugging, auto-completion, and compilation tools (e.g., Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA).
Version Control Systems (VCS) enable collaboration and track code changes (e.g., Git, Subversion (SVN)).

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Tight Deadlines – Use Agile methodologies and efficient time management.
Technical Debt – Regular refactoring and code reviews help maintain quality.
Collaboration Issues – Use project management tools like GitHub for transparency.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing – Tests individual components (e.g., a function in Python).
Integration Testing – Verifies interactions between modules.
System Testing – Tests the complete system to ensure it meets requirements.
Acceptance Testing – Ensures the software meets user expectations.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the practice of designing effective prompts to get the best responses from AI models. It is crucial for improving AI-generated outputs in chatbots, search engines, and automation tools.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Prompt: "Tell me about AI."
Improved Prompt: "Explain artificial intelligence, its key applications in healthcare, and its impact on medical diagnostics."
It is specific, providing clear expectations and context for the AI to generate a more relevant and detailed response.
